This project is currently suspended.
I must improve my maths skills for further development.

OpenCraft will be an open source Minecraft-like game. It is written entirely in C.
The project is currently in a non-playable, tech-test -ish state.

The source code might be a bit messy, but I'll clean it up in the future.


Technologies used:
	- SDL
	- OpenGL
	- DevIL (Image Library) !Will be replaced with SDL_image
	- OpenAL
	
Features that will be added definitely in the future:
	- Modding support by dynamically loading shared libraries (mods will be written in C/C++)
